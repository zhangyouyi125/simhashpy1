一种新型果树滴灌装置的制做和使用方法
　　这种有贮水功能的新型滴灌装置,结构简单、好操作、不堵塞,根治了传统滴灌堵塞、滴头滴水量不均的问题。因此，如何将粉煤灰合理利用于农业上，是值得讨论的重要问题。课题由卢家诚、朱世清同志负责，报告由刘鉴明同志执笔；杨国义、陈飞同志参加野外试验，罗薇同志参加室内化学分析。
2.3 菌根真菌的一般生理特性
　　所分离到的真菌都可以在营养成分不明确的天然介质中良好地生长。
2.1 提供了两种假设模型
　　这两种假设模型为固定效应模型和混合效应模型，具体计算过程见文献[6]。这不仅造成资源浪费，而且造成环境污染。关好流量控制器，利用各种水源过滤后给贮水器注满水备用。
　　在淀粉、纤维素、果胶等作碳源的培养基上，这些真菌在生长过程中会使环境中的pH由6.0降至5.3左右，这表明真菌在分解利用这些较复杂碳源的代谢过程中，会产生一些有机酸而使环境中的pH稍微下降，而这个酸度范围对真菌菌丝的生长有所抑制，但对根状茎的生长则影响不大。如果其级别内异质性经X 2检验显著，则说明假设不正确，此时按一定的标准将所有研究划分为几个级别，再进行分析。导流管的根数及长度根据果树的种类和大小及土壤种类来确定。很多粉煤灰是碱性的，其中钙、镁等碱性物质含量很高，因此可作为石灰代用品来降低酸性土壤的酸度。对于一片果园来讲，贮水器在单位面积内安装的数量可根据果树的种类、大小、密植度及自然降雨情况来确定。温度是支配凋落物分解速率的重要环境因素，它甚至能改变凋落物分解的动力学。把联接盘和注水口分别用热合机热合在指定位置，每个封头的底部应装2～4个联接盘，再将贮水器的2个封头对应地热合在筒体的两头，然后做注水试验，制作工艺完成。

　　A number of studies over the past decade have used state-of-the-art atmospheric, biospheric, and oceanographic models to estimate the potential magnitude of future climate change and related impacts on the biosphere[1～2]. These studies have demonstrated that the rate of climate change could be unprecedented in the recent geologic history and have large effects on the terrestrial biosphere. Soil organic matter (SOM) is a sensitive indicator of climatic patterns, and it can be expected to manifest measurable responses to global warming. This paper discusses climate change in relation to SOM in the light of some studies.
1 Soil as Part of the Carbon Cycle
　　The carbon in soil organic matter is a significant component of the earth’s carbon reservoirs, with around 1.5′ 1018 g. This is small compared with the carbon stored in the deep ocean (C 38′ 1018 g) and in the deep earth. The turnover time of carbon in the soil-vegetation system is variable, ranging from less than a year for annual vegetation, to thousands of years for organic matter parts of soil profiles[3]. 
　　The loss of carbon from both terrestrial biomass and soil organic matter has been considerable over the last 200 years. The calculation of the net release, over this whole period or currently per year, is very difficult due to the heterogeneity of the land surface, the variation in treatment or cover, and the uncertainty of the areas of particular ecosystems.
　　The current net release of C from soils and plants is estimated to be around 1015 g/a, but the uncertainties in the data and the variable assumptions and definitions used by different authors provide a very large margin of error. The total release of C since 1880 is estimated at 120′ 1015 g[3].
　　During the last century the major component of this was probably the loss of soil organic carbon from the cultivation of virgin grasslands, but now it is from the felling of forests, mainly in the tropics. A major complication occurs in peatlands, where the storage of C can be regarded as part of a soil reservoir, or as a separate compartment (subfossil C). Indeed, the whole question of carbon changes in wetland ecosystems is extremely interesting, because of the potential changes in coastal wetlands due to sea-level rise, as well as to temperature change and the production of CH4, another greenhouse gas, as well as CO2 from such systems. 
2 Influence of Climate Change on SOM
　　The total amount of organic matter in the soil depends on the balance of biomass production and decomposition, and on the soil capacity for organic matter storage. At global scales, a more general pattern is evident: SOM increases along gradients of increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature[4～5].
　　The role of temperature in determining the global pattern of SOM follows directly from its differential effects on production (additions to SOM) and decomposition (losses of SOM). SOM increases accelerate as temperature decreases, a finding that is consistent with the pattern revealed by aggregated data arrayed to show variations with both temperature and precipitation is held constant4～5]. Assuming that the shift in the SOM profile would be proportional to the temperature gradient, a 2 ℃ warming would shift the SOM profile poleward by 2.67 degrees latitude (approximately 300 km) and a 4 ℃ warming by 5.33 degrees (approximately 600 km). The predicted shift in steady state SOM in the Northern hemisphere is therefore on the order of 150 km/℃[6].
　　It has been argued that the stimulation of photosynthesis, the “fertilization effect” of increasing carbon dioxide, could more than compensate for these temperature effects. This is proving to be a more complicated problem than it might appear at first glance. How the temperature response of net primary productivity might be modified by increased CO2 concentrations is still difficult to predict. It is now clear, however, that the effects of the expected simultaneous increases in CO2 concentrations and temperature will have interactive effects on plant photosynthesis and respiration, perhaps combining to lower net photosynthesis at temperatures below 18 ℃ and increasing them above[7]. If this proves to be a general pattern it may mean that tropical latitudes will benefit more from the fertilization effect than temperate and boreal zones.
　　In terms of the global atmospheric CO2 pool however, it is the balance of effects on decomposition and production that are of concern. If the stimulation of photosynthesis by CO2 is the predominant effect, then CO2 concentrations should decrease as temperature increases and thus generate a negative feedback to CO2. If the stimulation of decomposition and loss of SOM is the predominant effect, then CO2 concentrations should increase with temperate and thus generate a positive feedback to CO2[6].
　　The recent completion of drilling at Vostok station in East Antarctica has allowed the extension of the ice record of atmospheric composition and climate to the past four glacial-interglacial cycles[8]. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 correlate well with Antarctic air-temperature throughout the record. Present-day atmospheric burdens of these two important greenhouse gases seem to have been unprecedented during the past 420000 years[8]. The decomposition and loss of SOM may be an important role in increasing concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere. MacDonald et al. (1999)[9] show that elevated soil temperatures may increase C loss from soils by accelerating microbial respiration and dissolved organic C leaching. Dissolved organic C leaching from soils may ultimately return to the atmosphere as CO2 lost from streams, lakes, or oceans[10]. Depending on the above and below-ground responses of forests to elevated atmospheric CO2 and warming[11～13], increased C fluxes from soils could create a positive feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations[1, 14].
3 Consequences of Soil Warming for Foliar Litter Decay
　　Litter decomposition plays a role in regulating the balance between C assimilation and release in terrestrial ecosystems. Temperature is a well-established environmental factor governing litter decomposition rates, with litter decay rates generally increasing with increasing temperature in the range 5～30 ℃[15～18].
　　A growing number of studies are using in situ soil temperature manipulations or “soil warming” experiments to test the response of key soil processes to altered thermal conditions[19～22]. These in situ soil warming experiments are not intended to simulate global climate change, i.e., the gradual increase in both soil and air temperature on decadel time scales. Rather, they provide a uniquely powerful tool to evaluate temperature controls on soil processes under field conditions. For example, Van Cleve et al. (1990)[19] demonstrated a significantly increased decomposition of the forest litter in a black spruce (Picea mariana) stand in Alaska in response to an 8～10 ℃ increase in soil temperature. Lukewille and Wright (1997)[22] showed a significant increase in NO3 and NH4 concentrations in runoff, which they suggested was due to increased N mineralization in a boreal forest catchment in Norway in response to a 3～5 ℃ increase in soil temperature. Rustad et al. (1998)[23] conducted a study to investigate the effects of soil warming on the decomposition of red spruce (Picea rubens) and red maple (Acer rubrum) foliar litter at Howland, ME. Experimentally increased soil temperatures (increase of 4～5 ℃) were maintained during the snow-free season from 1993 through 1995 in replicated 15 by 15 m plots using heat-resistance cables. For red maple litter, significant treatment effects included greater loss of mass (27%) and C (33%), and greater accumulation of Zn (54%) during the first 6 months of decay in the heated plots than the control plots. After 30 months of decay, significant treatment effects were no longer evident for red maple litter. Few treatment effects were observed for red spruce litter during the initial 18 months of decay. However, after 30 months of decay, significant treatment effects included greater loss of mass (19%), C (19%), N (24%), Ca (27%), Mg (12%), K (4%), Zn (60%), and cellulose (40%) in red spruce litter in the heated plots than the control plots. They concluded that a modest increase in soil temperature (4～5 ℃) can significantly increase litter decay rates and alter litter decay dynamics in this coniferous forest stand, and that these changes exhibit variations in their temporal development as a function of species and litter quality attributes[23].
