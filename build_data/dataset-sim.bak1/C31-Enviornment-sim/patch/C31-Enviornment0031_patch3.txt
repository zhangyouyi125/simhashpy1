　　A number of studies over the past decade have used state-of-the-art atmospheric, biospheric, and oceanographic models to estimate the potential magnitude of future climate change and related impacts on the biosphere[1～2]. These studies have demonstrated that the rate of climate change could be unprecedented in the recent geologic history and have large effects on the terrestrial biosphere. Soil organic matter (SOM) is a sensitive indicator of climatic patterns, and it can be expected to manifest measurable responses to global warming. This paper discusses climate change in relation to SOM in the light of some studies.
1 Soil as Part of the Carbon Cycle
　　The carbon in soil organic matter is a significant component of the earth’s carbon reservoirs, with around 1.5′ 1018 g. This is small compared with the carbon stored in the deep ocean (C 38′ 1018 g) and in the deep earth. The turnover time of carbon in the soil-vegetation system is variable, ranging from less than a year for annual vegetation, to thousands of years for organic matter parts of soil profiles[3]. 
　　The loss of carbon from both terrestrial biomass and soil organic matter has been considerable over the last 200 years. The calculation of the net release, over this whole period or currently per year, is very difficult due to the heterogeneity of the land surface, the variation in treatment or cover, and the uncertainty of the areas of particular ecosystems.
　　The current net release of C from soils and plants is estimated to be around 1015 g/a, but the uncertainties in the data and the variable assumptions and definitions used by different authors provide a very large margin of error. The total release of C since 1880 is estimated at 120′ 1015 g[3].
　　During the last century the major component of this was probably the loss of soil organic carbon from the cultivation of virgin grasslands, but now it is from the felling of forests, mainly in the tropics. A major complication occurs in peatlands, where the storage of C can be regarded as part of a soil reservoir, or as a separate compartment (subfossil C). Indeed, the whole question of carbon changes in wetland ecosystems is extremely interesting, because of the potential changes in coastal wetlands due to sea-level rise, as well as to temperature change and the production of CH4, another greenhouse gas, as well as CO2 from such systems. 
2 Influence of Climate Change on SOM
　　The total amount of organic matter in the soil depends on the balance of biomass production and decomposition, and on the soil capacity for organic matter storage. At global scales, a more general pattern is evident: SOM increases along gradients of increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature[4～5].
　　The role of temperature in determining the global pattern of SOM follows directly from its differential effects on production (additions to SOM) and decomposition (losses of SOM). SOM increases accelerate as temperature decreases, a finding that is consistent with the pattern revealed by aggregated data arrayed to show variations with both temperature and precipitation is held constant4～5]. Assuming that the shift in the SOM profile would be proportional to the temperature gradient, a 2 ℃ warming would shift the SOM profile poleward by 2.67 degrees latitude (approximately 300 km) and a 4 ℃ warming by 5.33 degrees (approximately 600 km). The predicted shift in steady state SOM in the Northern hemisphere is therefore on the order of 150 km/℃[6].
　　It has been argued that the stimulation of photosynthesis, the “fertilization effect” of increasing carbon dioxide, could more than compensate for these temperature effects. This is proving to be a more complicated problem than it might appear at first glance. How the temperature response of net primary productivity might be modified by increased CO2 concentrations is still difficult to predict. It is now clear, however, that the effects of the expected simultaneous increases in CO2 concentrations and temperature will have interactive effects on plant photosynthesis and respiration, perhaps combining to lower net photosynthesis at temperatures below 18 ℃ and increasing them above[7]. If this proves to be a general pattern it may mean that tropical latitudes will benefit more from the fertilization effect than temperate and boreal zones.
　　In terms of the global atmospheric CO2 pool however, it is the balance of effects on decomposition and production that are of concern. If the stimulation of photosynthesis by CO2 is the predominant effect, then CO2 concentrations should decrease as temperature increases and thus generate a negative feedback to CO2. If the stimulation of decomposition and loss of SOM is the predominant effect, then CO2 concentrations should increase with temperate and thus generate a positive feedback to CO2[6].
　　The recent completion of drilling at Vostok station in East Antarctica has allowed the extension of the ice record of atmospheric composition and climate to the past four glacial-interglacial cycles[8]. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 correlate well with Antarctic air-temperature throughout the record. Present-day atmospheric burdens of these two important greenhouse gases seem to have been unprecedented during the past 420000 years[8]. The decomposition and loss of SOM may be an important role in increasing concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere. MacDonald et al. (1999)[9] show that elevated soil temperatures may increase C loss from soils by accelerating microbial respiration and dissolved organic C leaching. Dissolved organic C leaching from soils may ultimately return to the atmosphere as CO2 lost from streams, lakes, or oceans[10]. Depending on the above and below-ground responses of forests to elevated atmospheric CO2 and warming[11～13], increased C fluxes from soils could create a positive feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations[1, 14].
3 Consequences of Soil Warming for Foliar Litter Decay
　　Litter decomposition plays a role in regulating the balance between C assimilation and release in terrestrial ecosystems. Temperature is a well-established environmental factor governing litter decomposition rates, with litter decay rates generally increasing with increasing temperature in the range 5～30 ℃[15～18].
　　A growing number of studies are using in situ soil temperature manipulations or “soil warming” experiments to test the response of key soil processes to altered thermal conditions[19～22]. These in situ soil warming experiments are not intended to simulate global climate change, i.e., the gradual increase in both soil and air temperature on decadel time scales. Rather, they provide a uniquely powerful tool to evaluate temperature controls on soil processes under field conditions. For example, Van Cleve et al. (1990)[19] demonstrated a significantly increased decomposition of the forest litter in a black spruce (Picea mariana) stand in Alaska in response to an 8～10 ℃ increase in soil temperature. Lukewille and Wright (1997)[22] showed a significant increase in NO3 and NH4 concentrations in runoff, which they suggested was due to increased N mineralization in a boreal forest catchment in Norway in response to a 3～5 ℃ increase in soil temperature. Rustad et al. (1998)[23] conducted a study to investigate the effects of soil warming on the decomposition of red spruce (Picea rubens) and red maple (Acer rubrum) foliar litter at Howland, ME. Experimentally increased soil temperatures (increase of 4～5 ℃) were maintained during the snow-free season from 1993 through 1995 in replicated 15 by 15 m plots using heat-resistance cables. For red maple litter, significant treatment effects included greater loss of mass (27%) and C (33%), and greater accumulation of Zn (54%) during the first 6 months of decay in the heated plots than the control plots. After 30 months of decay, significant treatment effects were no longer evident for red maple litter. Few treatment effects were observed for red spruce litter during the initial 18 months of decay. However, after 30 months of decay, significant treatment effects included greater loss of mass (19%), C (19%), N (24%), Ca (27%), Mg (12%), K (4%), Zn (60%), and cellulose (40%) in red spruce litter in the heated plots than the control plots. They concluded that a modest increase in soil temperature (4～5 ℃) can significantly increase litter decay rates and alter litter decay dynamics in this coniferous forest stand, and that these changes exhibit variations in their temporal development as a function of species and litter quality attributes[23].

　　Abstract:　Four endophytic fungi (unidetified) have been isolated from the roots of Cymbidium ensifolium growing in the mountain area of northern Guangdong province. The characteristic of mycorrhizal infection, general morphology and physiology of these isolates were investigated. The results showed that fungi hyphae were frequently present in root hairs sections that were 3～18 cm from root tip. Cortical infection was rarely seen in root tip and young roots. Almost all old roots have been invaded by mycorrhizal fungi. Fungi hyphae invaded root epidermis into cortical cells and formed pelotons there, but peloton were not seen in epidermal cells. The pelotons in cortical cell of Cymbidium sinense and C．ensifolium rhizomes began to digest after 9 days of infection. These isolates could utilize most of simple carbohydrate and nitrogen source except for nitrate.
